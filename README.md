## monkey_type_typing_bot (OCR-Powered) ü§ñ

**type_breaker** is a Python project designed to enhance WPM (Words Per Minute) scores specifically on the **Monkey Type** platform. By integrating **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology with **`pytesseract`**, this project can "read" the words displayed on the Monkey Type webpage and automatically perform the typing actions.

### key_features:

* **ocr_powered_typing:** Utilizes `pytesseract` to detect and convert text from images on Monkey Type into machine-readable data.
* **automated_wpm_scoring:** Helps users achieve faster and more accurate WPM scores on Monkey Type.
* **python_based:** Developed using Python, making it easy to understand, customize, and extend.

### technologies_used:

* **python:** The primary programming language used for development.
* **pytesseract:** A Python library for interacting with the Tesseract OCR Engine.

### project_objective:

This project was created for the purpose of studying and exploring the feasibility of using OCR to interact with websites, particularly in the context of typing games or tests.

## how_to_use_type_breaker

Follow these steps to get **type_breaker** up and running on your machine.

### prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:** **type_breaker** is built with Python.
* **Tesseract OCR Engine:** `pytesseract` is a Python wrapper for Tesseract. You'll need to install the Tesseract OCR engine itself on your system.
    * For **Windows**: Download the installer from [Tesseract-OCR GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
    * For **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    * For **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/xHexlabx/TypeBreaker.git](https://github.com/xHexlabx/TypeBreaker.git)
    cd type_breaker
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### running_type_breaker

After installation, you can run the bot using the provided script.

1.  **Navigate to the project root:**
    If you're not already there, change your directory to the **`type_breaker`** root folder (where `README.md` is located).

2.  **Execute the `run_type_breaker.py` script:**

    ```bash
    python scripts/run_type_breaker.py
    ```

    Upon running, the script will guide you through the process, which typically involves:

    * Opening your web browser to Monkey Type.
    * (Potentially) requiring you to adjust the Monkey Type settings for optimal OCR.
    * Automatically recognizing and typing the words.

### tips_for_optimal_performance

* **Screen Resolution:** Ensure your screen resolution is consistent, as OCR can sometimes be sensitive to changes in element sizing.
* **Browser Zoom:** Keep your browser zoom level at 100% on Monkey Type for the best OCR accuracy.
* **Monkey Type Theme/Settings:** Simple and high-contrast themes on Monkey Type tend to yield better OCR results. Avoid themes with complex backgrounds or highly stylized fonts.
* **Test Environment:** It's best to run **type_breaker** on a dedicated screen or window where no other applications overlap the Monkey Type interface.
