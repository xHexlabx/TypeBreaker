# TypeBreaker üêµ

## Monkey Type Typing Bot (OCR-Powered) ü§ñ

TypeBreaker is a Python project designed to enhance WPM (Words Per Minute) scores specifically on the **Monkey Type** platform. By integrating **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology with **`pytesseract`**, this project can "read" the words displayed on the Monkey Type webpage and automatically perform the typing actions.

### Key Features:

* **OCR-Powered Typing:** Utilizes `pytesseract` to detect and convert text from images on Monkey Type into machine-readable data.
* **Automated WPM Scoring:** Helps users achieve faster and more accurate WPM scores on Monkey Type.
* **Python-based:** Developed using Python, making it easy to understand, customize, and extend.

### Technologies Used:

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
* **Pytesseract:** A Python library for interacting with the Tesseract OCR Engine.

### Project Objective:

This project was created for the purpose of studying and exploring the feasibility of using OCR to interact with websites, particularly in the context of typing games or tests.
